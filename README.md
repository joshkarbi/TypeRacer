# SE3313-TypeRacer

### Todo
##### Backend
- Destroy running games if they timeout (i.e. nobody joins after some time)
- Confirm player disconnects are handled cleanly

##### Frontend
- Input box logic: when a wrong character is entered add it to a queue. Backspace key event pops a character from the queue
- Clear text box after each correct word
- Send msg to server after each correct word
- Display progress of all players
